# dtable-api-gateway

dtable-api-gateway provides unified APIs to access base data. It proxies APIs to dtable-server and dtable-db components. The provided APIs works with both unarchived (normal) storage and archived (big-data) storage.

## Configurations

The configuration options are available in `dtable-api-gateway.conf`. The options are grouped in sections. If the configuration file is not created, api-gateway will use the default configuration values.

### `[general]`

This section contains general settings about api-gateway service.

- `host`: The address api-gateway listens on. Defaults to localhost.
- `port`: The port api-gateway listens on. Defaults to 7780.
- `log_dir`: Location for the api-gateway logs in the container.
- `log_level`: Only log messages with level priority higher than this will be logged. Supported levels are "debug", "info", "warn", "error", with ascending priority. The default is "info".
- `base_api_limit_per_minute`: Limits the number of API calls per base per minute. If the option is set to a negative number, like -1, it means there is no limit. Default is 500. It's usually not suggested to change this configuration.
- `max_base_cache_size`: Maximum base cache size in MB. Defaults to 1024.

### `[cluster]`

This section contains settings about api-gateway working with dtable-server or dtable-db cluster.

- `etcd_endpoints`: The address of the etcd, which should be same etcd with the dtable-server or dtable-db cluster. It's required if you enable dtable-server cluster or dtable-db cluster. Defaults to 127.0.0.1:2379. It supports setting up multiple etcd endpoints like: 127.0.0.1:2379,127.0.0.1:2380.

### `[dtable-db]`

This section contains settings about api-gateway working with dtable-db.

- `cluster_mode`: Indicates whether dtable-db is running in cluster mode. Defaults to false.
- `server_address`: Address of the dtable-db instance. It's required if cluster_mode is set to false. You should not set it if cluster_mode is set to true. Defaults to 127.0.0.1:7777.

### `[dtable-server]`

This section contains settings about api-gateway working with dtable-server.

- `cluster_mode`: Indicates whether dtable-server is running in cluster mode. Defaults to false.
- `server_address`: Address of the dtable-server instance. It's required if cluster_mode is set to false. You should not set it if cluster_mode is set to true. Defaults to 127.0.0.1:7777.

## Example configuration

```
[general]
log_dir = ./log
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 7780
log_level = info

[cluster]
etcd_endpoints = "127.0.0.1:2379"

[dtable-db]
cluster_mode = false
server_address = "127.0.0.1:7777"

[dtable-server]
cluster_mode = false
server_address = "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
```
